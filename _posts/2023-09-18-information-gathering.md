#### Gathering Information on Your Targets

- Information gathering is the very first and most critical step of every penetration test. It does not matter if you have to assess the security of an entire network or a single web application, we need to know our target in as much detail as possible.
- At information gathering stage , there is no unnecessary information; everything you collect should be noted for future use. The wealth of information you collect will become useful in both understanding application logic and during the attack phase.
- What sorts of information are we going after?

  - Infrastructure (Web Server , CMS, Database...)
  - Application Logic
  - IPs, Domains and subdomains
  - Virtual hosts

  - #### Finding Owner, IP Addresses and E-mail

- For simplicity, we will pretend to be unaware of what systems and individuals are behind a given website.
- The first step to take when assesing a website is to gather information about the organization.

  - #### Whois
